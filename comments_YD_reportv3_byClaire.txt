    Chapter 1
____________________________________________________


L.10    You should start with a more general context, i.e. on High-Luminosity LHC program (one sentence). 
        Then down to ITk, briefly describing the overall design and finally the strip detector.
        That's the first paragraph of your abstract.
        You should add right after what we mean by a petal (look up Yu-Heng's report).
                
L.12    CO2 => CO outside of math type
L.13    This thermal cycle result (lack of thermal memory) is a "by-product" of our tests (we had to go down in temperatures so we recorded all the intermediary steps)
        But it is not the most important things we wanted to measure at the first place, that is to say the temperature of the silicon sensors of a powered + cooled down petal.
        So announcing this result gives way too much importance. On top of it, we did only one thermal cycles. Typical dedicated measurements of thermal memory involve ~30 cycles or more.
        I would quote instead the lowest temperatures we reached on the sensors.

L.15    remove "also"
L.16    "In addition, a thermographic correction". This is the main goal of the report and how measurements are made. So it should not be a supplement but it's the core of things
        This should be mentioned in the abstract (not too detailed such as quoting the black tape method, but stating that we correct the raw camera output).
L.18    "would eliminate the necesity of covering the petal surface with high emissivity black tape." => if you write this in the abstract, you need to define it more
        I would rather stay general with something like "this report details a method used to calibrate the temperature provided by the infra-red camera".
        
L.19    The viewing angle is rather to be seen as a preliminary study to understand more our system.
        If you really want to put it in the abstract (I would not), it should go before the final result.


First impression on the Table of Content:
        
        I would merge chapters 3 and 4.
        At least chapter 3 is not "Analysis", but "measurements".
        
L.58    "it’s however the most important component on the detector sensors." => component is usually used for electronics. Here we are dealing with a block of silicon.
        Suggestion: "it is what the sensors are made of"
L.60    sensor’s response => sensor’s thermal response.
        The connection between infrared thermography and FEA can be improved. You already justified the relevance of contact-free thermal measurements above.
        So you could say "Moreover, simulations using FEA give the thermal response of the sensors... " You could start a new paragraph on FEA in your intro I think.

L.62    "this simulation model have to" => has or models?
L.63    thermo-mechanical: uniformize the spelling. FYI TDR uses the dash.
L.75    "subsequent sections is" => "subsequent sections, is"
L.77    analysis methods => measurement methods? are we analyzing yet or just taking data?
L.78    "results are presented accompanied by a small discussion." => [up to you] "results are presented and discussed"

L.83    "Infrared measuring devices" => I am not sure we can say that. I would say "Such devices..." 
L.88    "to it which" => "to it, which"
L.89    you mention as first and unique caveat in this paragraph the path between object under study and camera. 
        This plays very little role in our case. It's a secondary issue, I would say.
        With this last sentence of the paragraph we can conclude that in vacuum we have no problem at all and the camera will always say the truth.
        I understand it's difficult to mention stuff like emissivity etc, as it's only the intro.
        But you should rephrase that end of paragraph so that the reader does not believe that infrared in vacuum is calibration-free.

L.93    is the lower limit 0.7 or 0.8 micrometres?
L.97    There are different division schemes but all the time (wikipedia, Infrared book) I do not see any gaps nor overlaps. Not the case here. 
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared
        Ref 11: Byrnes, James (2009). Unexploded Ordnance Detection and Mitigation. Springer. pp. 21–22. ISBN 978-1-4020-9252-7.
        So please fix the boundaries
        Suggestion: 0.75 - 1.4 - 3 - 8 - 15 
        (the 0.75 needs to be in the text to for consistency)
L.100   Far infrared?
L.109   Would it be better to write the equation without C1 and C2? They are defined with c, h, and k_B, 
        so I would just write the equation without these constants first, or at least put the definition of these C1 and C2 somewhere
        for exp() use "e"
        
        Figure 1.1 is pixelized. Any better resolution somewhere?
        Figure 1.2, caption: ... we can see the molecule responsible of the absorption.

        
L.117   Google does not find reference 6: 
        Selected critical applications for thermography: Convection in fluids, selective emitters and highly reflecting materials. 
        Proceedings of the Infrared Camera Calibration Conference, vol. 6, (Las Vegas (NV), USA), pp. 161-173, oct 2015.
        Could you send it to me please? Thanks.
L.126   opaque => you should precise opaque in infrared radiation
L.130   Incorrect English. Rephrase and check with a native speaker.
L.136   tempeture => " and wavelength".
L.140   You are reversing cause&consequence. It's because of the definition of a black body, which is an idealization, that any other object will emit less.
        So reverse the two proposition of that sentence to end with eps is between 0 and 1.
L.141   I do not see the emissivity constant on the graph.
L.141   grey body => no entry on Wikipedia nor the Infrared book. "Gray" exists. Correct and add the other image of the book.      
 https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/ContentImages/Proceedings/10452/104522C/FigureImages/00022_PSISDG10452_104522C_page_2_2.jpg
 (find a vectorial version if possible as this is too pixelized)
Figure 1.4: we can't see here that the black body yields maximum radiance. With respect to the others yes it's greater in value but who tells us it is a max? 
        Would remove this. Will be clearer once you add the other graph with eps_b at 1 for all lambda.
L.152   so-called
L.154   temperatures
L.161   "will have to absorb" => "will absorb"
L.165   "This law also applies to non-blackbodies" => as an approximation
L.177   "perceives" => rather "displays"
        these factors
L.178   would be cool to classify this as they did in the book: intrinsic object properties (material, surface, geometry) and other paramethers (viewing angle, wavelength, ambiant)
L.179   capital letters not necessary
L.184   these factors
L.192   These other contributions
L.193   on the target surface
Fig 1.6:"(D) external source radiation transmitted through the target." => external source of radiation    
Eq 1.11 write it first generally and then say we neglect the transmissive part and write the updated equation.
        Otherwise the equation, taken out of its context, is wrong, and we don't want that.
L.207   would remove "petal" parenthesis as you haven't defined the concept and it would be too long here. You have Chapter 2 for that.
L.214   where (no capital letter)
L.215   I would remove the footnote as it is not necessary + the current chapter is not about the setup
L.218   same as above 'where'
L.221   reference needed here. Also I am surprised I do not find much with a Google search and the book has p.118 one four-line paragraph on it.
        I think this efficiency is already accounted for. I would be happy to read your reference + exchange with Peter 
L.229   can we average? what are the physics justification?
L.236   just refer "see study ..." and don't detail too much in that theoretical introduction
L.239   I would start a paragraph entirely dedicated to the angular dependence
L.241   capital letter blackbody + remove extra space
L.242   radiance has 2 occurances, one p.6 and here p.9 but it is not defined. Caution: irradiance != radiance. See Infrared book or https://goo.gl/J588aH        
L.247   it is not an approximation, it's the law: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert%27s_cosine_law
L.248   the necessity of the measurement came from other experimental factors we cannot quantitatively estimate (property of the surface, etc)
        and the geometry of the setup having different angles along the petal's length. You need to rephrase here.

L.251   reminder of "thermo-mechanical" to stay coherent in your report + with respect to TDR
L.252   the reader may better understand if you do not start by quoting petal but rather
        zoom in as you nicely did afterwards, with key words end-cap => discs => support structures.
        Then you can state they are called "petals"
L.254   remove "structural" and be more general instead of "CO2 cooling" => provides the electronics and cooling services.
L.255   a petal has 9 sensors, remove parentheses for silicon
L.256   ATLAS Phase II (reverse order)
L.257   add mostly because R0 is not. "parts" => replace by "modules" and you can add it has "blank silicon" 
L.261   the employment of non-contact ... very difficult (typo non-contact + order of words)
L.263   the metallic finish is at the back. Writing this may confuse the reader as the metallic part is reflective... 
        sugested workaround: you can summarize the whole by being general on the different waffers
L.264   would remove this sentence (it diminishes your work for no reason!)
Figure 2.1  the global support structures are shown on the left (you can add some petals are drawn). Replace "design" by schematics
L.265   don't mix modules and rings
L.275   "the prototype counts with real cores" => what is "real" in this case? say "built with the real materials" (with respect to preliminary petal designs)
Figure 2.2 used for
L.280   support tends to refer to the end-cap structure. "vertically inserted in a custom rail system"
L.284: "on the one hand ... on the other hand" = used when you are comparing two different facts or two opposite ways of thinking about a situation
        say "first... second" or "moreover"
L.292   angle of incidence
L.316   infrared opaque
L.323   there is no interference pattern here. Just "blurred the thermogram"
L.326   more precisely: that a petal thermo-mechanical prototype was cooled down using by-phase CO2.
L.330   four? (one per ring + 1 eos ) x 2 sides
L.332   write: (25 W for one side's powerboard plus 3 W for the Eos)
L.334   remove the set point difference as it is related to TRACI operations.
        Moreover this was not safe, as we had no way to control this except tweaking manually
        I would remove it, as it is too close to the unknown zone on how to use TRACI properly.
L.346   maintained by a piece of high emissivity black tape

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Main comment: 

Your report is structured with the different measurements in this chapter + the results in Chapter 4.
That could work, but in your case I think your report would be much better to have

Chapter 3: Preliminary Measurements
Chapter 4: Calibrated Thermograms

First it would flow better because you will have the results following right after the description of each measurement.
Second it is crucial to end your report with the main, most relevant results. Other satellite measurement contributing to it should be detailed beforehand.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

L.352   ...surface, it .. (add comma)
L.359   add internal control ... and *the* distance 
L.360   the reader doesn't know (yet!) that all part of the alu foil is a region of interest.
        you can add: "..., i.e. an area of the aluminium foil" or something like that
L.364   remove s at distance
L.365   "The emissivity and distances settings of 1.00 and 0 m respectively are just telling the camera that record everything 
        without applying any further correction" => awkward phrasing
        => The camera emissivity is set to 1.00 and the distance to 0 so that the IR camera software does not apply any further correction.
L.370   add "the" for emissivity and apparent temperature
L.378   suggestion: split this long sentence in two: "The surface was coated with..." + water temperature goes down
L.380   the emissivity
        I am not sure I understand this. What do you want to say here?
        moreover you say L.445 "Let’s now discuss another method, known as the “baseline image” method." I am confused on the methods here. 
L.396   remove "known emissivity coating"
L.398   "necessary measurement parameters in the IR camera software" => which ones? 
L.403   repeating won't decrease the uncertainty due to the resolution of the camera
        I would go for a safer phrasing saying that we can to average out the "flickering effect" of the thermograms
L.405   on the silicon surface
L.414   Let's
Eq.3.2  not sure it is okay with the indices. Should be Si and not TB. Or I didn't get the reasoning here.
        Edit: ok never mind I think I get it.
        However it is confusing in the way it is introduced.
        We can talk about it on how to explain best but as we are looking for T_Si, perhaps it's better to start from there.
L.422   the small trick seems to be an equation rearrangement but it is rather motivated by the physics.
        I would strongly recommand to rephrase.        
L.432   the black tape used for this setup has an emissivity...
L.434   till line 436: sentence not grammatically correct and too long. Split in two and put for the second the concept
        of thermodynamical equilibrium
L.438   trustable => calibrated, or adjusted   
L.441   Additionally,... => I would add this sentence on Si markers right after the one on BT markers
L.445   "If" => Let's
L.450   why italic?
L.458   "from one to the other" => inbetween
L.464   put the footnote exponant on the "impossible"
L.467   not sure viewing angle is the proper term. Suggesting "Influence of radiation emission angle"
L.468   "viewing angle of the camera with respect to the normal to the petal" => angle of incidence of the petal's emitted radiation 
L.469   studies are not angular :) just put "a dedicated study" or "a study"
L.470   "Petal. and" => please correct + rephrase "viewing angle"
L.475   typo "ro's" => rod
